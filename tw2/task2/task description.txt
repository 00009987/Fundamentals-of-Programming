Programming exercise II – Calculator project
1.	Enhance the program so that result is given in the following way
	2 * 3 = 6
	i.e. with the operands, operator and result
2.	Enhance the program to check if user has input anything into textboxes before conducting evaluation
3.	Check if the values entered into textboxes are numeric. In case of empty input the program should give notification via msgbox and do not 	calculate result
4.	Let’s assume that operations are allowed on integers only. Check if the input is integer. Use the following algorithm: 
	a.	Check if the input is numeric
	b.	Cast input to double
	c.	Check for integer using Math.Round() or Math.Floor() and Math.Ceiling()
